### Design
```vhdl
-- Entity declaration for 4-bit binary comparator

entity comparator_4bit is
    port(
        a_i             : in  std_logic_vector(4 - 1 downto 0);
		b_i             : in  std_logic_vector(4 - 1 downto 0);
        --
        B_greater_A_o   : out std_logic;
        B_equals_A_o    : out std_logic;
        B_less_A_o      : out std_logic       
    );
end entity comparator_4bit;


-- Architecture body for 4-bit binary comparator

architecture Behavioral of comparator_4bit is
begin

    B_greater_A_o  <= '1' when (b_i > a_i) else '0';
    B_equals_A_o   <= '1' when (b_i = a_i) else '0';
    B_less_A_o     <= '1' when (b_i < a_i) else '0';

end architecture Behavioral;
```
