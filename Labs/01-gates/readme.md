### Listing of VHDL code of  - architecture :
```
architecture dataflow of gates is
begin
    f_o  <= ((not b_i) and a_i) or ((not c_i) and (not b_i));
    fnand_o <= not(not((not b_i) and a_i) and not((not c_i) and (not b_i)));
    fnor_o <= not(b_i or (not a_i)) or not(c_i or b_i);

end architecture dataflow;
```
